JSON Parser is a web application that allows you to parse and visualize JSON data. It provides a user-friendly interface to load JSON data from a file or paste it directly into the text area. You can then render the JSON data as HTML and copy it to your clipboard. This project is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
